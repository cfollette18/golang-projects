# GoLang Projects Portfolio

## Welcome to my GoLang projects portfolio! 
This repository showcases my skills in building backend applications using Go (Golang). Below is a list of my Go projects:

## Projects
- **[Go-Movies-Crud](https://github.com/cfollette18/golang-projects/tree/main/go-movies-crud)**: A RESTful API for managing a collection of movies with full CRUD operations.
- **[Drouhlin](https://github.com/cfollette18/golang-projects/tree/main/Drouhlin)**: A RESTful API for managing bank accounts with operations like account creation, retrieval, deletion, and fund transfers, featuring JWT-based authentication and PostgreSQL storage.

## About Me
I’m Clinton Follette (GitHub: cfollette18), a developer passionate about building efficient backend systems. This portfolio is a work in progress, and I’ll be adding more Go projects to showcase my skills.
